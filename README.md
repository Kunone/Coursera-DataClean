Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

Two files included:
1. run_analysis.R

2. CodeBook.md

Noted: In order to run run_analysis.R, please download and unzip following file

run_analysis.R
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains following implementation.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 



CodeBook.md
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file explain the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
